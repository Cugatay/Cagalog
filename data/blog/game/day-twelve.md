Hello Mr. and Ms. reader, today is a lonely day just like always. Means this is a good time to blog about it.

So far so now, I have finished the whole welcome and login pages ðŸ¥³ And with this achievement, the main coding is not even started yet. Because now it's time to code main menu. But I noticed something new, we don't have any Graphql function to get main menu. So, the first thing is gonna be writing a main menu function. Then we can continue with other stuffs.

But I wasn't joking when I was saying lonely day. And I feel like I have to go out to wander. I will be still alone but not like a nerd who writes code. So, see you when I'll come back.
