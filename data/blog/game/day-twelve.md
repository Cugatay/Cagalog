summary: I'm Trying to Build a Web-Based Game

Hello Mr. and Ms. reader, today is a lonely day just like always. Means this is a good time to blog about it.

So far so now, I have finished the whole welcome and login pages ðŸ¥³ And with this achievement, the main coding is not even started yet. Because now it's time to code main menu. But I noticed something new, we don't have any Graphql function to get main menu. So, the first thing is gonna be writing a main menu function. Then we can continue with other stuffs.

But I wasn't joking when I was saying lonely day. And I feel like I have to go out to wander. I will be still alone but not like a nerd who writes code. So, see you when I'll come back.

# At the Midnight as Always

Here we are again. I fixed some bugs on Welcome pages. And now, when we onboarded we can see the home screen, with our avatar, username and win count. And if we click anywhere on the screen, we'll join to a game. But that's it, for now we can't join a game. It's not just because I didn't code it yet, it's also because we have to write some codes on backend too. The reason of this is backend is not changing the game status with our gameUpdated subscription. I guess it'll we be easy to implement. But that was it for today fellows. Take care of yourselves. And pray for me, because I wanna study some school stuff. And also I got some bad news about my country, we have 2 martyr and 2 wounded. So, actually don't pray for me; If you care about it, would be better to pray for them. Thanks, good night you all.
