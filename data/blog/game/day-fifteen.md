Yeah, you may think like "This blog series is not regular anymore, he is not posting some days" I am sorry, I was so sick yesterday. And still I am, but I think I can work today. And the first thing was joining the game.

To be honest, subscriptions are very hard on frontend. I couldn't tackle with it 2 days ago, and still trying to subscribe to updatedGame subscription. When I will achieve this thing, we will be able to continue with designing stuffs. But I'm not sure how can we implement this thing. So, we'll move on faster when I will finish it.

Oh my god, oh my god. I DID ITTT! The problem was just the son of a ***** link. We don't use /subscription link, we are just using /graphql link mann. The problem was just this! I spend my day for this oh my god. This is insane!!! This is the first time that I get something in graphql instantly and securely!!
