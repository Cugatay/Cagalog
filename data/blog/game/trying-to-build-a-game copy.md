summary: I'm Trying to Build a Web-Based Game
---

Long, really long time ago, I decided to create a website for my friends. For close circle I mean. And worked on that website for day and night. With a wish, just a wish. Not to raise money, I just wanted to fun. After 5 months, I already gained more than fun. I had a lot of experience about creating and managing a project now. `But my first wish never been alive`. No one used my website, it's actually really reasonable, because there were no reason to use my website. So now, I have enough experience to build a website in a shorter, really shorter time. And today, I'm starting to do that!
