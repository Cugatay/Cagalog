Hello traveller, and welcome to the day two. Today's job is most about building the backend (I guess). But first, I didn't finish the last design page, which is role choice screen. So, I think I should finish it first. And let me show you other designs that I didn't show you yet:

Main Menu:

Avatar Choice Screen:

So that's it, now we can continue with today's tasks.

# I'm Done With The Design (I Hope)

Now, the screen designes have finished. And I'm sure that it's not finished at all, I'll have to change something in design. But the bad thing about the designs is animations are not explicit. I'll have to find how can I animate things in coding section. That's faster and I think I can handle with this issue. So now, I am able to go with the coding section. Yey, or fâ€¢ck.

# Coding Babe

Let's talk about my approach to developing an app. First thing I do is a feature list and page/screen designs. It makes me feel more comfortable, because if I have a design, I also have a guarantie that my app is gonna look like that. And designs also makes frontend coding section easier. Because thanks to designs, you know all components' position and pagination with each other. And now we have finished that section. Now it's time to coding, and let me tell you my coding approach.

# A Little Break

So, I'm here again :D I had a math lesson man, that's tough. Now I'm here. And yeah, let's continue to talk. Finding a coding approach took some of my time. But at the end, the important thing is coding like building a tower. You'll need to build foundations to don't get stuck later. Just like in coding. You need to start from beginning. If you have a design, it doesn't mean that you can start with frontend. Because frontend gets data from backend. So, my plan of building app is now like this:

- Create a Feature List / UI Design (You can split this into two different step of course)
- Create a Back-End Structure (Like database structure and backend function list)
- Code Backend With Looking This Structure And Your Feature List
- Code Frontend With UI Designs
- Connect Backend From Frontend

And I'm also gonna split Subscriptions part (Websockets) as a different step. Because it's gonna be necessary. So, let's start with writing down Backend Structure.
