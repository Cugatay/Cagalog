Hey, welcome, again, friend? Today I have two options to work on: Fixing and adding vote stuff. For fixing, I have to add a leave game function, which deletes the player if game is not started yet, or if the game started, it kills player.

And voting stuff is actually the last part of MVP version. So, if I finish it I can play with my friends, which is the most exciting thing. And also if we don't fix these bugs today, it doesn't affect anything else, it just continues like now it is. So I prefer to finish the MVP version, so we can play the game and we can say this game is funny or not. This is the plan for now, see you. This is gonna take some time.
