Welcome to the beginning of the month, bros. And, I feel like I'm burning out some. Project is involving slower. Today I'm still working with the message screen design. And let me talk about it.

It's gonna be a modal, like it shows itself up when you click the messages button. You can swipe down to close. But the details of the message component is not ready yet. I'm trying to find the best design for it. And it'll take a little bit more. Meanwhile, maybe I can try to reach the friend I want to draw an avatar picture.
