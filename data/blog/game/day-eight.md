Today is a very exited day. It's because I have finished the backend codes yesterday, and today it's time to start to the mobile code :D yey, that really makes me happy. Because the backend codes of my last project took my 4 months to finish man. And I didn't even know how can I implement subscriptions. And now, it took just 7 days :D Just one week. I call that improvement.

And also Jeff Bezos is going to space today, that's an interesting step on space history. When people start to travel in space we will talk about these days without doubt. We can look at this event with different kinds of perspectives. Like this is an important event, and I'm just writing a video game. Or we can say, Bezos started with selling books. And my biggest advice that I can give you is always look at the good perspective and always be motivated. It's your everything, no one is gonna finish your works, they will help you, if you work. So, dream big, start slow.

So, today is a beautiful day for these reasons. But we have more. Today is sacrificial feast, which we go to visit our relatives. Today is really good man, didn't think like that :D I don't like to go out for all the day, but my relatives deserve this. But the thing with that, today I'm not able to continue coding this project. I can start, but I want to code it for hours if I start. So, I'm not starting to code mobile codes (which makes me really happy to say) yet. And now I'm watching the Ble Origin's live stream -Jeff Bezos's space company- They will launch the first human spaceflight one hour later.
