summary: I'm Trying to Build a Web-Based Game

Oh my god! I'm so exited now. Let me tell ya'll what happened. Last night I finished the voting function on backend and tried to implemen voting for frontend, and finished 50% of this implementation. And today I finished it! Not just it! Now users can die. Yes man, I added this game violance lol.

Jokes aside, this last implementation means that I finished the MVP version, and now it's ready to share. But before sharing this app, I have to let you know that there are some known bugs, just like the view on big screens like tablets, and victory screen. But, they are pretty simple bugs I guess, and it doesn't affect the MVP version. I mean we can still test this project out. Now, I'll have to build this baby for android. But first, as you can remember I have a backend. So, I need a server to run backend. For now, it was running on my computer, but just I can access my computer, not others. So, I need to purchase a server to share my app. Let's do it!

# Took Very Little Really!

Hey, do you remember me? I was the guy who said the MVP version is done. Well, it's done, and it was done when I said that. But the thing is, if you're not a programmer, probable you don't the deployment process. It's called "my ex-wife" in programming. You don't need to think so much on this, but it takes your all time, and you never expect that it takes this long. So, my ex-wife is the best illustrative, lol.

And for me, it took my almost whole day to implement. But now we have an apk application link. But, I'm sure that I'll update this app tomorrow. I'm gonna change the backend server. For now it's using Digitalocean, which is the best and server provider. I actually love Digitalocean than the others, as I told you it's the best for me. So, why I'll change this. Well, for now I want to pay as low as I can. And Google Cloud, which I hate if I'm using it with paying, is free for 90 days. So, these 90 days will be the beta process of this application.

If you want to take an advice about servers, I suggest you to do it like me. Because this way doesn't hurt you at all. You try your application for 90 days on Google without any doubt and then switch to a better provider. But why Digitalocean is better in my perspective? Because it's only mission is providing services, not like Google. And this makes its UI, user experience and service better. They're much more understandable than Google Cloud. And I'm not sponsored by Digitalocean. Just FYI.

And today was meaningful for me. Because I developed my last application in 6 months. Though this didn't take even 1 month, huh lol. This makes me really happy, and also scary. Because my last application had 1 downloads if you don't count me. So, hope Vamping's destiny will be different.

By the way, now you can install this app. But this link will be deactivated in 1 month. And also this version will be deactivated tomorrow, 'cuz I'm gonna change the backend, though here is the link:
