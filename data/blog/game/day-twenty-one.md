summary: I'm Trying to Build a Web-Based Game
---

I have a big problem. I have a really big problem. There is a Component called BlurView, it's been created from Expo, the big software that I'm using with react native. It helps me to run react native without downloading Android Studio, and much more software. But now, I have a problem with it's BlurView. In iOS, it's really good. It's really bluring background. But in Android, it's just a f**king transparent white. I have used this in 2 components, and I'm not sure what can I use instead. Oh boy, why it is not working well, this is not true. Expo, why didn't you just work on it. I have to find a sulution, and mobile programming is bad man :) I didn't like these problems. In web, we could build everything without these errors. That's bad. But, of course it's more useful than any web app. That's also bad.

So, today was like that. I'm so close to the end. But also not close as I thought.
