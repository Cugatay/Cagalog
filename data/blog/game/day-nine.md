summary: I'm Trying to Build a Web-Based Game
---

Hello fellows, today it's time to create the mobile app! And the hardest thing is starting. I have to do the things at the beginning, like installing somo packages, building state management system (I'm using Zustand, it's the best for me), building the stack navigation stuffs, and more. But the happiest thing is, backend just took 1 week. And it's all ready to go to action.

Actually the thing that I'm gonna do later is building avatar things. It's not ready on backend because I don't know how should it be. I want it customisable, but it would be really hard to code. So, we will see it. First thing is making this app playable with friends man.

# Thoughts Are Wrong Sometimes

It's 02:06 pm now, and the things are not working like I thought. I can here your question, "What was wrong". First, if you know some UI design stuff, my design is glassmorphism-heavy design. Glassmorphism is the blurred stuffs that you can see in every screen design. And it has a lot of limitations in coding. Because it is an iOS stuff, and works well in SwiftUI, not in every language I guess. But I'm still working about it, and I'll do it. But the other wrong thing with the design is the welcome screen.

It just has Login and Register buttons with the icon of our app. It means a bad start for our users. Because they have no info about our app, and this is also a bad design, because there is almost nothing to see and think about. So, I need to add explanatory cards at the beginning. I'm not sure how could I call them, but you'll understand when you'll see. But I guess this is all for today. You are able to say that today I did nothing. And you are right; but man, this is coding. You'll get stack on something everytime. But we will tackle with these problems.
